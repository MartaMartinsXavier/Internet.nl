# Even more: The documentation states that time limit support only exists for prefork and gevent. It does not
#  mention eventlet. So eventlet _might_ work, prefork _will_ work. Eventlet seems to hang in later versions
# The -P option is documented here:

# Todo: we don't have a nassl_worker queue anywhere, so why start it?
